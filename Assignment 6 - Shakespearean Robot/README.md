# Shakespearean Robot Assignment Page:


### Intended play and scene:

In this assignment, my intended play is "Hamlet," as the robot will perform Act 1, Scene 2, from the play.

### Plans for the Shakespearean Robot:

- The Shakespearean robot's first objective is to have a human's appearance by including to its body a head, two hands, and legs (which will be the motorized wheels).
- The second objective is to allow the robot move as a response to his dialogue.
- This assignment's last objective is to introduce some sense of background to the robot's performance, which will enhance the relationship between the robot and its tragic position in the play.

### Intended experiments on the Shakespearean Robot:

Because the robot faced issues moving on a slippery surface, I am thinking of an experiment to change the wheels' material to anything that allows good friction to occur. Such as elastics.

### The scenery:

In this performance, the Shakespearean Robot will act as King Claudius in the play that addresses the court his miserable feelings and talks about his brother's death. After the robot performs King Claudius's feelings, he will address constitutional issues by talking about the Prince of Norway, Fortinbras.

The costume of the robot should contain a sense of superiority. Placing a crown in the robot's head and implementing blue and red colors in the costume will describe power in the old ages.

### The program:

In this assignment, the robot is controlled by a button. The button placed at the top of the robot has an LED that guides the users to the start point. In the program, the MP3 player, OLED Display, and the Motors are controlled by the button's initialization. The MP3 player and Motors are the only elements in which activate in a loop of saved data. For instance, the Motors have directed motion in the performance, and the MP3 player is required to play one track. The OLED display, however, is ON for the entirety of the play.

### Description:

The Shakespearean robot represents King Claudius in a Hamlet scene where he addresses his sorrow feelings for his loss and shows how the Prince of Norway, Fortinbras is corrupt. The sense of sorrow is performed throughout the robot's play as it starts to identify Prince Fortinbras as corrupt by the end of the performance.

The robot in this play is meant to expressive to the audience in two aspects. Those two aspects are related to each other to create an anthropomorphic sense to the robot. Sound (by Dialogue) and Movements are the two aspects that narrated feelings to the robot's performance. The Movements of the robot depends on the dialogue by an act to it. For instance, when the robot says something deep in sorrow, the action will stop for 5 seconds. Besides, if the robot is talking about a topic or description about a person such as Prince Fortinbras, the robot will move randomly by going straight, backward, right, and left. 

In an aspect of the performance, the robot can crash into things to show anger and depression by how the robot is attempting to kill itself when hitting nearby objects. If the battery is disconnected from its body, its program, which is the robot's heart or brain, will be wiped. In this case, if the robot is flipped to the floor, it will not be easy to get back right. Thus, leading to the drain of the battery and damage to its inner elements.

### Challenges:

In this assignment, I struggled to create a background set for the Robot due to time limitations and space for the robot's movements. As mentioned in my intentions section, the background is an element that helps to add additional understanding to the robot's performance.

The second challenge I experienced in this assignment is the OLED Display Bitmap portrayal. In the program, I have created a crown-like figure to be presented in the robot; however, the representation of the crown did not succeed. Instead, the OLED Display shows the same drawing in the robot but different sizes and random lines at the bottom. In this case, the OLED display means that the Display dimensions were not initialized as proposed in the program. In the program, the dimensions of the crown logo were right but did not succeed. I then tried to find another method of upload a bitmap to Arduino. The process was to convert a picture to bitmap and then to use a software that translates a bitmap to bits in Arduino. Many examples online described the same method; however, the converter software is only supported by Windows and not Mac.
