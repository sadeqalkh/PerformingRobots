# Shakespearean Robot Assignment Page:


### Intended play and scene:

In this assignment, my intended play is "Hamlet," as the robot will perform Act 1, Scene 2, from the play.

### Plans for the Shakespearean Robot:

- The Shakespearean robot's first objective is to have a human's appearance by including to its body a head, two hands, and legs (which will be the motorized wheels).
- The second objective is to allow the robot move as a response to his dialogue.
- This assignment's last objective is to introduce some sense of background to the robot's performance, which will enhance the relationship between the robot and its tragic position in the play.

### Intended experiments on the Shakespearean Robot:

Because the robot faced issues moving on a slippery surface, I am thinking of an experiment to change the wheels' material to anything that allows good friction to occur. Such as elastics.

### The scenery:

In this performance, the Shakespearean Robot will act as King Claudius in the play that addresses the court his miserable feelings and talks about his brother's death. After the robot performs King Claudius's feelings, he will address constitutional issues by talking about the Prince of Norway, Fortinbras.

The costume of the robot should contain a sense of superiority. Placing a crown in the robot's head and implementing blue and red colors in the costume will describe power in the old ages.
