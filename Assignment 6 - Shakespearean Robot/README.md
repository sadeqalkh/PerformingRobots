# Shakespearean Robot Assignment Page:


### Intended play and scene:

In this assignment, my intended play is "Hamlet," as the robot will perform Act 1, Scene 2, from the play.

### Plans for the Shakespearean Robot:

- The Shakespearean robot's first objective is to have a human's appearance by including to its body a head, two hands, and legs (which will be the motorized wheels).
- The second objective is to allow the robot move as a response to his dialogue.
- This assignment's last objective is to introduce some sense of background to the robot's performance, which will enhance the relationship between the robot and its tragic position in the play.

### Intended experiments on the Shakespearean Robot:

Because the robot faced issues moving on a slippery surface, I am thinking of an experiment to change the wheels' material to anything that allows good friction to occur. Such as elastics.
