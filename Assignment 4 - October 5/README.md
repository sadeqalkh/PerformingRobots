### Concept:
The program's concept is to let the user experience a prototype or a child version of the main project. The program starts by outputting data from the MP3 player, giving the user a context to the robot's role and personality. The robot starts by saying, "Hello, dear humans. My name is Alpha, the robot. My job in my body is to move within a loop. I can move forward, backward, right, and left." Because the text needs 18 seconds to play, the motors will start moving after 10 seconds from the start. The robots will perform movements, as said by the robots. The robots' script will be playing in a pattern in which it will be said for the first time, skip the second, and restate again in the third motors' loop. The robot's voice is presented in a lower pitch or child pitch because it represents a prototype's development stage. The robot is in the processing of learning how to walk and talk to all humans with no coding background.
