### Concept:
The program's concept is to let the user experience a prototype or a child version of the main project. The program starts by outputting data from the MP3 player, giving the user a context to the robot's role and personality. The robot starts by saying, "Hello, dear humans. My name is Alpha, the robot. My job in my body is to move within a loop. I can move forward, backward, right, and left." Because the text needs 18 seconds to play, the motors will start moving after 10 seconds from the start. The robots will perform movements, as said by the robots. The robots' script will be playing in a pattern in which it will be said for the first time, skip the second, and restate again in the third motors' loop. The robot's voice is presented in a lower pitch or child pitch because it represents a prototype's development stage. The robot is in the processing of learning how to walk and talk to all humans with no coding background.

### Outcome:
This assignment allowed me to experience how I can align Qwiic connections in a contraption. I acknowledged how to play MP3 audio in a loop and function motors in a loop.

### Challenges:

My challenge in this assignment was not considering my initial idea due to complexity. In my first idea, My intension was to create a robot that controls the motors when MP3 audio plays. It was hard to think of a solution since I felt a button could be more manageable when considering robot controls. However, adding a button to my robots seemed to alter my main idea and the robot's intension to the audience. Thus, I had to include one audio instead of five to solve one problem and perform in a pattern loop.

My second challenge was to play audio in a pattern. Most MP3 trials were not initializing as intended by how the audio tended to play sometimes once and at times within a random loop. My solution to this was to create functions with different roles in the robot.
