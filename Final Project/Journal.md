# Draft Journal:

### Song:

Blake Shelton - God's Country

### Charcter:

In this project, one main character will represent the singer, and three to four sub-characters will represent the main character's background. 

### Costume: 

- The robot in this performance should be humanoid in appearance. That is because it will be much easier for the audience to associate themselves with the robot.
- The costume theme will be 'country' based, which will represent the southwest of the US. All characters in the performance will be wearing a cowboy hat and red or blue t-shirt with blue jeans.

### Technical Requirements:

- The robot in the performance should be able to communicate with the song because he is a singer. Due to this aspect, it is required from the robot to move its motors right, left, and straight. 
- The OLED display in the performance will have a role to show the robot's mouth. That is by portraying animations of moving mouth, and constant mouth movements.
- This performance will not need an MP3 player because the sound effects will be synchronous, meaning that the background sounds/music will match the performance in the post-production process.

### The Environment:

The set of performances will take place in a desert and a barn.
There will be two plans for the set:

#### Plan A:

The performance will take place on a green screen. In this case, the background will be dynamic, meaning that the performance can occur in multiple locations. 
The requirement for this plan is the LED lights and a green sheet.

#### Plan B:

The performance will take place on a stage. In this case, the background will be the same; however, different angles from the set will establish a dynamic feeling. The stage will contain sand, animal puppets, and barn model.
The requirements for this plan are changing LED lights, sand, and background characters.

### The Action:

In the performance, I intend to let the robot respond to the music, meaning that the robot's moving pace will depend on the music's tone.
When the music's tone is higher, the robot will be active, which is by dancing (wiggle in most cases).
When the music's tone is lower, the robot will slowly move forward, letting the robot approach the audience. The robot, in this case, will evoke that he is the main character of this performance.
