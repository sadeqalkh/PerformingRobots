# Welcome to S.A.M's Performance Page

## Week 1

### Song:

Blake Shelton - God's Country

### Charcter:

In this project, one main character will represent the singer, and three to four sub-characters will represent the main character's background. 

### Costume: 

- The robot in this performance should be humanoid in appearance. That is because it will be much easier for the audience to associate themselves with the robot.
- The costume theme will be 'country' based, which will represent the southwest of the US. All characters in the performance will be wearing a cowboy hat and red or blue t-shirt with blue jeans.

### Technical Requirements:

- The robot in the performance should be able to communicate with the song because he is a singer. Due to this aspect, it is required from the robot to move its motors right, left, and straight. 
- The OLED display in the performance will have a role to show the robot's mouth. That is by portraying animations of moving mouth, and constant mouth movements.
- This performance will not need an MP3 player because the sound effects will be synchronous, meaning that the background sounds/music will match the performance in the post-production process.

### The Environment:

The set of performances will take place in a desert and a barn.
There will be two plans for the set:

#### Plan A:

The performance will take place on a green screen. In this case, the background will be dynamic, meaning that the performance can occur in multiple locations. 
The requirement for this plan is the LED lights and a green sheet.

#### Plan B:

The performance will take place on a stage. In this case, the background will be the same; however, different angles from the set will establish a dynamic feeling. The stage will contain sand, animal puppets, and barn model.
The requirements for this plan are changing LED lights, sand, and background characters.

### The Action:

In the performance, I intend to let the robot respond to the music, meaning that the robot's moving pace will depend on the music's tone.
When the music's tone is higher, the robot will be active, which is by dancing (wiggle in most cases).
When the music's tone is lower, the robot will slowly move forward, letting the robot approach the audience. The robot, in this case, will evoke that he is the main character of this performance.

## Week 2


### Assembling the robot's contraption:

For this week, I started my contraption by starting the head of the robot and the balck paint in which will define the robot's character. Firstly, the head contraption was challenging because I had to think on an "easy to fix" contrabtion. Based on my previous experiences in this class, I realised that it is important to consider that the Robot at times will need inner maintainance for even worse, an upgrade. Because of this factor, I thought that the neck part of the robot will not be glued to the body and that is to simplify updrages or even fixings in the future. In all, the contraption relied on gravity and tension instead of glue. It did not only simply maintainance but also created a good looking shape to the robot.

### Geometric body as a principle for the robot's idenity:

While finishing the base of the contraption, I used a scissor and a box cut to create geometric shapes to the robot. My intension from this geometric approach was to establish an idenity to the robot, this is merely based on nature. In other words, nature in terms of design does not follow the principle of sharp edges, geometric lines and square shapes in living beings. Instead, nature implement curvatures and unedged endings for us humans to identify all walks of life.

### Script writing and mise-en-scêne

In film language mise-en-scêne corresponds the relationship between a main character to his surroundings. This conveys that in this final project, the robot should have a direct relationship to his surroundings, in the manner of creating a narrative behind an identity. Due to the implementation of this element in the final project, the script should not only consider words for the robot but instead, to influence his actions and behaviors.
The script process involved including the motor movements, OLED display and finaly, the path in which the robot will follow to create a narrative. Because most audience will consider robots as passive tools with no emotions, I am trying to defeat this ideology in my film. This is by including a white background in the establising scene, in which will allow the audience to be introduced to the robot and not merely the performance. Hence, it will raise ideas and questions to how this robot can be attached socially to humanbeings.
Because I started thinking about the social context of the robot, the song in which represents cowboys will hopefully evoke ideas of social attachments to the robot. In sum, this song will help construct the idea of the robots reidenifying their idetities to match human's understanding.
