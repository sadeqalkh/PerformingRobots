# Welcome to S.A.M's Performance Page

## Week 1

### Song:

Blake Shelton - God's Country

### Charcter:

In this project, one main character will represent the singer, and three to four sub-characters will represent the main character's background. 

### Costume: 

- The robot in this performance should be humanoid in appearance. That is because it will be much easier for the audience to associate themselves with the robot.
- The costume theme will be 'country' based, which will represent the southwest of the US. All characters in the performance will be wearing a cowboy hat and red or blue t-shirt with blue jeans.

### Technical Requirements:

- The robot in the performance should be able to communicate with the song because he is a singer. Due to this aspect, it is required from the robot to move its motors right, left, and straight. 
- The OLED display in the performance will have a role to show the robot's mouth. That is by portraying animations of moving mouth, and constant mouth movements.
- This performance will not need an MP3 player because the sound effects will be synchronous, meaning that the background sounds/music will match the performance in the post-production process.

### The Environment:

The set of performances will take place in a desert and a barn.
There will be two plans for the set:

#### Plan A:

The performance will take place on a green screen. In this case, the background will be dynamic, meaning that the performance can occur in multiple locations. 
The requirement for this plan is the LED lights and a green sheet.

#### Plan B:

The performance will take place on a stage. In this case, the background will be the same; however, different angles from the set will establish a dynamic feeling. The stage will contain sand, animal puppets, and barn model.
The requirements for this plan are changing LED lights, sand, and background characters.

### The Action:

In the performance, I intend to let the robot respond to the music, meaning that the robot's moving pace will depend on the music's tone.
When the music's tone is higher, the robot will be active, which is by dancing (wiggle in most cases).
When the music's tone is lower, the robot will slowly move forward, letting the robot approach the audience. The robot, in this case, will evoke that he is the main character of this performance.

## Week 2


### Assembling the robot's contraption:

For this week, I started my contraption by starting the head of the robot and the balck paint in which will define the robot's character. Firstly, the head contraption was challenging because I had to think on an "easy to fix" contrabtion. Based on my previous experiences in this class, I realised that it is important to consider that the Robot at times will need inner maintainance for even worse, an upgrade. Because of this factor, I thought that the neck part of the robot will not be glued to the body and that is to simplify updrages or even fixings in the future. In all, the contraption relied on gravity and tension instead of glue. It did not only simply maintainance but also created a good looking shape to the robot.

### Geometric body as a principle for the robot's idenity:

While finishing the base of the contraption, I used a scissor and a box cut to create geometric shapes to the robot. My intension from this geometric approach was to establish an idenity to the robot, this is merely based on nature. In other words, nature in terms of design does not follow the principle of sharp edges, geometric lines and square shapes in living beings. Instead, nature implement curvatures and unedged endings for us humans to identify all walks of life.

### Script writing and mise-en-scêne:

In film language mise-en-scêne corresponds the relationship between a main character to his surroundings. This conveys that in this final project, the robot should have a direct relationship to his surroundings, in the manner of creating a narrative behind an identity. Due to the implementation of this element in the final project, the script should not only consider words for the robot but instead, to influence his actions and behaviors.

The script process involved including the motor movements, OLED display and finaly, the path in which the robot will follow to create a narrative. Because most audience will consider robots as passive tools with no emotions, I am trying to defeat this ideology in my film. This is by including a white background in the establising scene, in which will allow the audience to be introduced to the robot and not merely the performance. Hence, it will raise ideas and questions to how this robot can be attached socially to humanbeings.

Because I started thinking about the social context of the robot, the song in which represents cowboys will hopefully evoke ideas of social attachments to the robot. In sum, this song will help construct the idea of the robots reidenifying their idetities to match human's understanding.

### Challenges:

While going throught the Motor test, I realised that the motor drivers is not longer functioning. During this unpredicted action, I started to try every possible solution. At first, the motor driver did not only stopped working as it influenced Arduino to stop working. This way determined when the Arduino. did not send messages or initializations to other component such as the button and the OLED display. Additionaly, the motor driver stoped Arduino from blinking. Because of this feedback, I thought that the Qwicc wires were the issue due to the beleive that they are not functioning. When I tried the same wires in the different components, they worked and also allowed Arduino to blink. Secondly, I realised that the motor driver when trying all Qwicc wires did not blink. This aspect allowed me to think of a final alternation, which is to unscrew the motor and battery wires from the motor driver and re-screwing them again. The attempt did not succed and thus, I confirmed that the motors will not work until I get a new one.

Because of this challenge, I redirected my thought into developing the performance's narrative and not to focus on Arduino until I get hands on a new motor driver. The challenge was time, in which this issue did not allow me to develop Arduino. This is mainly because I was disencouraged.

### Costume:

## Week 3

### The Robot's spirit code:

In this step of the week, I was struggling in how to generate a robot's spirit. I thought of two animations that are critical the the robot's representation. The first animatation had the role in establishing the mouth of the robot. The second animation in mind represented a moving mouth. For us, this will signify a speech.Iimplementing these idea was a challeng, this is because it wasn't possible for me to convert images into bitmap. This step was time consuming because most suggested websites failed and so did the researched webs. Because of this aspect, I thought of creating the animations manually which depended on my imagination skills.

I followed a paper sketch to create drawing in bitmaps. Creating them took from me 3 hours but succedded in representing my ideal imagery.

The other two facial expressions that were applied to the robot's spirit were:

Emotionless reaction: This helped me in establing a base reaction for the robot's idenity. This is because robots in my performance demonstrate that they learn from humans and so, the emotionless reaction takes place in representing a robot's alienating behavior.

Surprised reaction: This reaction is intended to be used two times in the film; however, I consider them to be the most powerful reactions in the performance. This is because it plays a role in directing a message of a shocked or an 'error' reaction when approaching human's society. This representation from the spirit also allows the audience to think that this Robot is visiting an alien world were he need to learn alot but firstly, mimicing humans.



### The Robot's motor code

In this step, I was trying essentially to understand how to build up a relationship between wheels and the legs. For most scenes, the legs (wheels of the robot) are not represented to the audience and this is to center the focus into the robot's idenity. In other words, I am trying to not let the audience distracted from the robot's wheels than other actions. This idea was possible by having close-up shots of the robots. 

Secondly, I did not want the audience to feel distracted from the robot's motors. My solution to this problem is to motivate a relationship between the motor's path and the performance's background. For instance, in some scenes, the performance takes place in a road or a surface, the motor's role is to move within a specific path to portray realistic actions in a green screen. In the desert scene for instance, humans will have difficulties walking in desert sand while a sandstorm is occuring. The robot in this manner will represent this struggle by wiggling in which represents crawling or hard walks by humans.
