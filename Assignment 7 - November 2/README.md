### Picture 1:
In this picture, the loading screen icon will suggest the Robot's existence and stop an act. For the user, the loading screen icon portrays a message of patience. Additionally, users realize that their computers or mobile phones are stopping to perform as requested. This shows that a human's reaction from this icon can help assist the Robot to convey a stop signal. The middle circle's presence in this icon is to show the users that the Robot is still present in his space.

### Picture 2:
This picture portrays an animation of the Robot's eye, which starts from the outer layer to the inner circle. This motion of layers can demonstrate an introduction to the Robot's identity. At the top right of the picture, three animations suggest the front, left, and right motion of the eyes. These eye movements will help to relate the OLED display to the Motors.

### Picture 3:
This picture portrays an animation that intends to translate the Robot's movements. This animation can be shown faster when the Robot's speed is 200, and above, a normal pace is when the Robot's speed is between 100 and 200, and a slower pace if the Robot's speed is below 100. Hence, this animation can express slow-walk, normal-walk, and running.
