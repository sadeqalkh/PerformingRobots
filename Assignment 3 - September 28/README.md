### Concept:

The program's concept is to let the user visualize his/her button presses counts in the OLED display. As the program starts functioning in the OLED display, the user will be looking at the 'Adafruit' logo. The OLED display logo can be recognized by the user as a welcome or start page to the button count. As the user presses once on the start page, the program will direct the user to another page display "Button Pressed." When the button is unpressed by the user, the program will lead the user to a page display "Count" with a value that starts from 1 and increments forever by 1. Thus, leaving the user with a count value that demonstrates the total number of button presses.

### Outcome:

This assignment allowed me to acknowledge new inputting data methods by using the Sparkfun Qwiic Button and the Adafruit OLED display. 

### Challenges:

My main challenge in this assignment is experimenting with new ways of inputting data to Arduino pins, for instance, realizing the difference between digitalRead and digitalWrite to true and false statements. The true and false statements in Qwiic Button's functions made me acknowledge how the program reads declarations such as digitalWrite to how a programer can explain a button methodology in "button.isPressed." if it was HIGH = true or LOW = false.
